<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to put aside the console and make your application look like this:</p>

<p>Just create a window that displays the field of the game and counters (current generation and number of alive cells). For displaying the field, you can use methods that draw lines and fill rectangles. For counters, use simple text labels.<br>
    <br>
    It may look like you need to make a different application, but if youâ€™re using the MVC pattern, you can add one or two classes to your code.<br>
    <br>
    The application should start and begin to update its look with every new generation in the game. For this stage no any interaction with the user is necessary.</p>
